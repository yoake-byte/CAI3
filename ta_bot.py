    def __init__(self, config: dict) -> None:

        Initialise the TA-Bot.

        Parameters
        ----------
        config : dict
            Required keys set by the harness (do not hard-code their values):
                endpoint   : str   – vLLM-compatible base URL
                model      : str   – model name served at the endpoint
                corpus_path: str   – path to the paper corpus directory
                temperature: float – generation temperature (0 for graded runs)
                seed       : int   – random seed for reproducibility
            You may add custom keys for your own use.

        message: str,

        """
        Process one user turn and return an answer with citations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        session_id : str
            Conversation scope — a new session_id starts a fresh
            conversation but keeps the user's cross-session memory.
        user_id : str
            Memory scope — identifies the user whose memory store
            to read from and write to.
        message : str
            The user's message.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            {"answer": str, "citations": list[str]}
            - answer: the bot's response (complete, no streaming)
            - citations: list of paper_id strings from the corpus
              that were used to produce the answer. May be empty
              if no retrieval was needed.

        Raises
        ------
        TimeoutError
            You MUST raise TimeoutError if the endpoint is
            unreachable or a request exceeds your timeout.
            The harness catches it and marks this turn as 0.
            Do NOT let the process hang — raise, don't wait.

        Clear all stored memory for the given user.

        The harness calls this before each memory-probe sequence
        to ensure a clean slate. After this call, ``get_memory(user_id)``
        must return an empty list.

        Parameters
        ----------
        user_id : str
            The user whose memory to clear.

    def get_memory(self, user_id: str) -> list[str]:
        """
        Return the current memory store for the given user as a
        list of human-readable fact strings.

        This is read-only — calling it must not change the store.
        The harness uses it to inspect what your bot chose to remember
        (and what it chose not to remember).

        Any internal representation is fine as long as each entry
        serialises to a readable string.

        Parameters
        ----------
        user_id : str
            The user whose memory to inspect.

        Returns
        -------
        list[str]
            Stored facts as readable strings. Empty list if nothing
            is stored (or after ``reset_memory``).
